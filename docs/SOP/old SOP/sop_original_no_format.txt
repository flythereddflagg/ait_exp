Title: AIT Measurement Apparatus Standard Operating Proceedure
Last Modified on: ???

1 Preparation
2 Flask and Lid
3 Use a 500 mL, round bottom, long2neck flask
3 If dirty, wash out the flask using soap and water and dry as much 
as possible
4 Any leftover water will boil away when the furnace heats up and 
before any measurements are taken
3 Wrap entire flask in aluminum foil with thermocouples at the bottom,
side and top of the round part of the flask (thermocouples should 
be touching the glass directly) 11 gloves?
4 Start by getting a long strip of aluminum foil (8" wide or 
so) and wrapping it around the middle of the flask
4 Poke thermocouple 13  through the foil near the bottom so 
the bead sists at the bottom of the flask and then wrap the 
foil around the bottom
4 Slide thermocouple 12 down to the middle of the flask 
between the flask and foil and start to wrap the foil up 
the flask
4 Place thermocouple 11 at the top of the bulb of the flask 
and wrap the rest of the foil up around the top
4 Wrap additional foil around the neck of the flask to cover 
it completely and secure flask in lid assembly
4 Make a "donut" of foil that will rest up against the bottom 
of the lid assembly
3 Loosen the nut on top of the lid assembly and slide the corresponding 
half of the ceramic part of the lid assembly out
3 Place the flask in the ceramic part of the lid assembly with the lip 
of the flask fitting into the groove of the ceramic
3 Slide the loose half of the ceramic back intoback into be snug around 
the flask neck and tighten the nut on the top to hold it
in position
4 The two halves nearest to the top of the assembly should 
meet or very nearly meet; if they don't then some 
foil should be removed from the neck of the flask
4 Use a circular spring to help hold the halves together
3 Slide the foil "donut" up so it is flush against the ceramic and 
basically seals the opening
3 Carefully turn the flask/lid assembly over making sure the flask 
doesn't fall out
4 The flask will fit into the lid assembly somewhat loosely, 
but it shouldn't fall out
4 If the flask falls out, remove it and add more foild around 
the neck
3 Guide the thermocouple wires in the gap between the two ceramic 
halves so they are out of the way when the flask/lid assembly is 
inserted into the furnace
3 Place the prepared flask/lid assembly into the furnace

2 Furnace
3 Power on furnace and set temperature for initial measurement
4 To change the set poing, press the up aor down arros until 
the desired temperature is reached
3 Insert flask interior thermocouple (14) carefully down the flask 
neck, making sure it goes straight in thnd the bead doesn't get 
caught anywhere
4 The bead of thermocouple 14 should be suspended in the 
approximate middle of the flask, not be touching any part
4 Use the bracket on one of the two handles on top tof the lid 
to secure the thermocouple in place
3 Connect the thermocouples to the DAQ


1 Measurementand Data Collection
2 Start up computer and log on
3 Username: McKay
3 Password: asdfghjkl (Home row on qwerty keyboard)
2 Open "AIT Data Collection.vi" (Shortcut Located on Desktop)
2 Press the "run" button to start the program
2 Measure out sample
3 Draw sample amount into a right2angle syringe
3 Sample size:
4 Initially use a sample size of 100 microliters
4 Once AIT is measured for 100 microliters, go to 150 microliters
4 If the AIT decreases for 150 microliters, go to 200/250 
microliters
4 If the AIT increases for 150 microliters, go to 50 microliters
2 Enter the filename in the textbox
3 Path: "C:\AIT\<COMPOUND NAME>\<FILENAME>.txt"
3 Filename naming convention: 
4 Filenames will be organized by the following values in order 
separated by underscores ("_")
2 Compound name
2 Sample size in microliters
2 Temperature in degrees Celsius
2 Date of experiment with the format "YYMMDD"
4 For example: The filename of an AIT experiment where 100 
microliters of hexane were tested at 450 C on March 19, 2013 
would be: "hexane_100_450_130319.txt"
3 Make sure to press enter to save the filename in the labview program
2 Set a timer for 10 minutes but don't start it yet
2 Depress the peadal marked "D" to initiate data collection
2 Introduce your sample about 325 seconds after initiating data collection
3 Immediately begin the 10 minute timer and depress the pedal marked 
"L" to turn off the small light in the hood
2 Watch the mirror above the furnace for any flame/glow for 10 minutes
3 If a flame or glow is observed, document it (color, size, brightness, 
sound) and then continue data collection for 1 minute after the 
flame or glow has disappeared, then terminate data collection
4 If the flame is bright yellow/orange, this is the hot2flame 
autoignition and the temperature should be decreased for 
the next test
4 If the flame is faint and blue2ish, this is the cool2flame 
autoignition and the temperature should be increased for 
the next test
4 The reported AIT is the minimum temperature at which 
hot2flame ignition occurs
4 If no flame or glow if observed by the 10 minute mark, 
increase the temperature for the next measurement
4 The bracket size goal for AIT measurement is +2 3 deg C

2 Prepare for the next measurement
3 Set furnace to next temperature
3 Clean out the flask between measurements by blowing hot air into the 
flask for 5 minutes using the heat gun
3 Wait a minimum of 10 minutes between measurements for the furnace to 
equilibrate at the next temperature (5 min w/heat gun, 5 min 
to equilibrate)

2 Start this proceedure over from the third step (measuring out a sample)


1 Clean2up/Shut2Down
2 The furnace may be too hot to open for several hours
2 Once the furnace is cool, remove flask/lid assembly
2 Remove flask from lisd and remove the aluminum foil
2 Wash out flask with soap and water (scrubbing stains if necessary) and 
place on drying rack
2 Do not rinse out needles

Last Modified on: ???

# Preparation
    - Flask and Lid
        * Use a 500 mL, round bottom, long-neck flask
        * If dirty, wash out the flask using soap and water and dry as much 
            as possible
            ** Any leftover water will boil away when the furnace heats up and 
                before any measurements are taken
        * Wrap entire flask in aluminum foil with thermocouples at the bottom,
            side and top of the round part of the flask (thermocouples should 
            be touching the glass directly) ## gloves?
                ** Start by getting a long strip of aluminum foil (8" wide or 
                    so) and wrapping it around the middle of the flask
                ** Poke thermocouple #3  through the foil near the bottom so 
                    the bead sists at the bottom of the flask and then wrap the 
                    foil around the bottom
                ** Slide thermocouple #2 down to the middle of the flask 
                    between the flask and foil and start to wrap the foil up 
                    the flask
                ** Place thermocouple #1 at the top of the bulb of the flask 
                    and wrap the rest of the foil up around the top
                ** Wrap additional foil around the neck of the flask to cover 
                    it completely and secure flask in lid assembly
                ** Make a "donut" of foil that will rest up against the bottom 
                    of the lid assembly
        * Loosen the nut on top of the lid assembly and slide the corresponding 
            half of the ceramic part of the lid assembly out
        * Place the flask in the ceramic part of the lid assembly with the lip 
            of the flask fitting into the groove of the ceramic
        * Slide the loose half of the ceramic back intoback into be snug around 
            the flask neck and tighten the nut on the top to hold it
            in position
                ** The two halves nearest to the top of the assembly should 
                    meet or very nearly meet; if they don't then some 
                    foil should be removed from the neck of the flask
                ** Use a circular spring to help hold the halves together
        * Slide the foil "donut" up so it is flush against the ceramic and 
            basically seals the opening
        * Carefully turn the flask/lid assembly over making sure the flask 
            doesn't fall out
                ** The flask will fit into the lid assembly somewhat loosely, 
                    but it shouldn't fall out
                ** If the flask falls out, remove it and add more foild around 
                    the neck
        * Guide the thermocouple wires in the gap between the two ceramic 
            halves so they are out of the way when the flask/lid assembly is 
            inserted into the furnace
        * Place the prepared flask/lid assembly into the furnace
    
    - Furnace
        * Power on furnace and set temperature for initial measurement
                ** To change the set poing, press the up aor down arros until 
                    the desired temperature is reached
        * Insert flask interior thermocouple (#4) carefully down the flask 
            neck, making sure it goes straight in thnd the bead doesn't get 
            caught anywhere
                ** The bead of thermocouple #4 should be suspended in the 
                    approximate middle of the flask, not be touching any part
                ** Use the bracket on one of the two handles on top tof the lid 
                    to secure the thermocouple in place
        * Connect the thermocouples to the DAQ


# Measurementand Data Collection
    - Start up computer and log on
        * Username: McKay
        * Password: asdfghjkl (Home row on qwerty keyboard)
    - Open "AIT Data Collection.vi" (Shortcut Located on Desktop)
    - Press the "run" button to start the program
    - Measure out sample
        * Draw sample amount into a right-angle syringe
        * Sample size:
            ** Initially use a sample size of 100 microliters
            ** Once AIT is measured for 100 microliters, go to 150 microliters
            ** If the AIT decreases for 150 microliters, go to 200/250 
                microliters
            ** If the AIT increases for 150 microliters, go to 50 microliters
    - Enter the filename in the textbox
        * Path: "C:\AIT\<COMPOUND NAME>\<FILENAME>.txt"
        * Filename naming convention: 
            ** Filenames will be organized by the following values in order 
                separated by underscores ("_")
                    - Compound name
                    - Sample size in microliters
                    - Temperature in degrees Celsius
                    - Date of experiment with the format "YYMMDD"
            ** For example: The filename of an AIT experiment where 100 
                microliters of hexane were tested at 450 C on March 19, 2013 
                would be: "hexane_100_450_130319.txt"
        * Make sure to press enter to save the filename in the labview program
    - Set a timer for 10 minutes but don't start it yet
    - Depress the peadal marked "D" to initiate data collection
    - Introduce your sample about 3-5 seconds after initiating data collection
        * Immediately begin the 10 minute timer and depress the pedal marked 
            "L" to turn off the small light in the hood
    - Watch the mirror above the furnace for any flame/glow for 10 minutes
        * If a flame or glow is observed, document it (color, size, brightness, 
            sound) and then continue data collection for 1 minute after the 
            flame or glow has disappeared, then terminate data collection
                ** If the flame is bright yellow/orange, this is the hot-flame 
                    autoignition and the temperature should be decreased for 
                    the next test
                ** If the flame is faint and blue-ish, this is the cool-flame 
                    autoignition and the temperature should be increased for 
                    the next test
                ** The reported AIT is the minimum temperature at which 
                    hot-flame ignition occurs
                ** If no flame or glow if observed by the 10 minute mark, 
                    increase the temperature for the next measurement
                ** The bracket size goal for AIT measurement is +- 3 deg C
                
    - Prepare for the next measurement
        * Set furnace to next temperature
        * Clean out the flask between measurements by blowing hot air into the 
            flask for 5 minutes using the heat gun
        * Wait a minimum of 10 minutes between measurements for the furnace to 
            equilibrate at the next temperature (5 min w/heat gun, 5 min 
            to equilibrate)
    
    - Start this proceedure over from the third step (measuring out a sample)


# Clean-up/Shut-Down
    - The furnace may be too hot to open for several hours
    - Once the furnace is cool, remove flask/lid assembly
    - Remove flask from lisd and remove the aluminum foil
    - Wash out flask with soap and water (scrubbing stains if necessary) and 
        place on drying rack
    - Do not rinse out needles

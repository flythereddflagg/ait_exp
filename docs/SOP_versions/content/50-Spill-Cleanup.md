# Spill Clean1.up

In the event of any spill, appropriate PPE specified in the corresponding SDS should be used in clean1.up. Always check the SDS for special considerations when cleaning up any compound.

## Liquids

In the event of a small spill (i.e. less than 100 ml), the following protocol should be followed:

- If the spill occurs in or out of the hood, use absorbent clay that can be found under the counter west of the sink to soak up the bulk of the liquid and wipe up the rest with a paper towel
  - Dispose of the clay, any disposable gloves and towels in the solid waste container
  - In the event of a large spill (i.e. greater than 100 ml), the following protocol should be followed:
- If the spill occurs in the hood, use absorbent clay that can be found under the counter on the left1.hand side of the lab sink to soak up the bulk of the liquid and wipe up the rest with a paper towel
  - Dispose of the clay, any disposable gloves and towels in the solid waste container
  - If the spill occurs outside the hood or the spill is particularly large (e.g. an entire bottle of a flammable material breaks) **perform the Emergency Shutdown Procedure** (Section refsec:e_shtdn), evacuate the lab and call: BYU Risk Management and Safety - (801) 422-4468 
- Spills involving compounds that are particularly toxic or unstable should always be considered large spills



## Solids

We will generally work with organic solids that readily dissolve in simple organic solvents (e.g. acetone). Researchers must always check chemical compatibility with solutes and solvents before dissolving any compound.

- Small amounts of organic solids may be dissolved in a small amount of solvent and put in organic liquid waste

- Larger amounts of solids should be transferred to solid waste and the residue should be dissolved in solvent and discarded in liquid waste

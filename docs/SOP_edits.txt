4.1.1:
remove 
4.1.4: 
fix spelling. Equilibrate

4.1.4 bullet point 1 & 2:
Switch the order of bullet points
Point 1: "When initially powered on (Step 3), ...."
Point 2: "Therefore, wait..."

4.1.9
Fix File Path to be: C:\Users\Public\Documents\AIT\ait_exp\TADA\TADA_firmware

4.1.12 Bullet points
Point 3: Remove "in the hood"
Point 4: ...align the camera's view "to see through the sight glass" directly...
	remove the notes under point 4. Replace them with new tips for angling the 
	mirror correctly.
Point 6: Remove this point about the hood

4.1.13 
Remove this point

4.2.1 
Change this to, "In the lab notebook, record the absolute pressure of the lab"

4.2.2
Either Remove entirely or adjust it to a humidity test using hygrometer with the
air leaving the Pressure Vessel once an elapsed (time) has passed.
 - Need to do testing to decide this
 
4.2.5
There is a hand written note. A more simple way to say it is: "Tare the scale 
with the weigh boat"

4.2.6 delete and change (I haven't finished this part, I would separate this in 
to two sections. Liquid and Solid) 
 - Liquid Sample 
	Place syringe into syringe holder in ARIA, making sure the tip of the 
		syringe is aligned with the hole in the furnace lid
	
 - Solid Sample
	Weigh out sample in plastic weigh boat
	Carefully insert weigh boat into the holder on ARIA, making certain it is 
		secure
	
	
ADD HERE
	Place the lid on the PV and secure in place with the clamps
	Based on the lab's absolute pressure, determine the pressure increase needed
		to obtain atmospheric pressure inside the vessel and adjust the control 
		air inc. pressure regulator to this pressure
	(There needs to be something here about adjusting the outlet flow rate. I'm 
		not exactly sure how that will work)
	If it is the first run of the day, ensure that ARIA is in the lowered 
		position. If it is not, manually lower it until it is touching the plate.
		Plug in the ARIA power source and allow it to reach stand-by 
		position.If it is not the first run, ensure ARIA is in stand-by mode and
		the arm	is in the raised, stand-by position. The LED lights will be lit, 
		indicating it is in stand-by mode.
		
4.2.8 Dependant upon lighting test results

4.2.11 Remove

4.2.12 Remove

4.2.13 Remove, although I think there should be something we do to indicate that 
	the sample has been injected.
4.2.13a  remove

ADD HERE	
	Press the LED button that corresponds to the physical state of the sample.
	Green = Solid
	Blue = Liquid

4.2.13c remove	

4.2.17

ADD HERE	
	Wait the specified time to allow for pressure vessel to be purged. 
	After the specified time and all safety percautions have been met, turn off
		the inlet flow of air and take the lid off the pressure vessel.
	ATTENTION: Anytime the pressure vessel lid is removed, the snorkel should be 
		placed over the furnace

		
4.3
	Remove Dash 2
	Remove dash 3
ADD HERE
	Unplug the power cable from ARIA 
	Manually lower the arm until it is touching the plate.
